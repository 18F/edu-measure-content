This is a repository of documents for 18F Edu's "How to test and measure content" course.

How does one identify great content? While it might be easy to lean on Justice Potter Stewart’s famous mantra, “I know it when I see it,” a number of tools exist to help us determine if our content is performing the way we hope.

Whether you’re a visual designer or a full stack developer, it’s likely the tools and websites you’re creating are filled with words. In this module, we’ll show you how to test those words, both through usability research and other methods of objective measurement.
