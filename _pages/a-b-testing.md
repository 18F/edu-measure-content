Sometimes, the content you’re working on is more microcopy than sweeping paragraphs. Alas! The Cloze test and readability indexes aren’t ideal for determining if such copy meets your needs. With A/B testing, you’ll compare two versions of content to see which performs better.

A/B tests are also an excellent way to test how users connect with your content. Maybe your site is easy to read and understand, but users aren’t interacting with it in the way you hoped.

The UK’s Government Digital Service has a [compelling case study](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/18/organ-donor-register/) of A/B testing content for an organ donation sign-up.

The National Health Service (NHS) deployed eight variations of content asking users to sign up as organ donors. For example:

- *Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register.*
- *Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register. Three people die every day because there are not enough organ donors.*
- *Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register. You could save or transform up to 9 lives as an organ donor.*

They measured the sign-up rate for each piece of content. The most successful was:

- *Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register. If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one? If so please help others.*

Each content variant the NHS tested was plain language and are easily understood. The A/B test illuminated which call to action was most effective.
