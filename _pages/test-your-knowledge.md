It’s not possible to undertake usability testing in the hypothetical— the unpredictability of human response is what makes it so valuable. That said, a good first step toward improving content is increasing its indexed “readability.” Take a look at the paragraph below:

*NOAA enriches life through science. People rely on NOAA for weather forecasts and warnings, healthy coastal waters, a long-lasting supply of seafood, safe movement of ships, oil spill recovery and more. Our scientists look at the world up close and from far away, study plankton with microscopes and look at the whole Earth using satellites. NOAA's national marine sanctuaries and national estuarine research reserves provide great opportunities for recreation and protect our nation's underwater and coastal treasures. So check the weather, use your nautical chart, learn about your ocean and coasts and be a good steward of your planet on an adventure with NOAA.*

This content measures at a 11th grade reading level, with 14 complex words and an average of 22 words per sentence. Take a stab at editing for clarity and concision. When you’re finished, paste it into a [readability index](http://www.editcentral.com/gwt1/EditCentral.html#style_diction), and see your results.

Here’s our take:

*We enrich life through science. People rely on us for weather forecasts and warnings. We also protect the coast. This includes making sure we have plenty of seafood and that ships can move safely in our oceans. Our scientists look at the world up close and far away. They study tiny plankton and look at the earth from space. Our sanctuaries and research reserves have great places where you can relax and protect our ocean and coastal treasures.* 

This version has a 4.5 grade level, with 3 complex words and 11 words per sentence.
