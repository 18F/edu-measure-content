## Cloze test

The Cloze test can help you measure readers’ comprehension. In the Cloze test, you'll give participants a selection of text with certain words removed. Then you'll direct them to fill in the blanks. 

When creating a Cloze test, you can delete words using a formula (for example, every fifth word), or you can delete selectively (just key words). You can accept only exact answers, or you can accept synonyms. If you want statistically sound data, we recommend that — however you enact the Cloze test — you’re consistent. And sample as many readers as possible. 

In the past, we’ve selected passages of at least 150 words, deleted every fifth word, and accepted synonyms as answers. Our target has been 50 percent or greater accuracy. 

Of note: We don’t use the Cloze test when we measure content with children. Tests are a ubiquitous stress for many school-age kids. Even with the disclaimer that we’re testing our content and not their performance, we’ve found children get distressed completing Cloze tests. As such, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.
