## Reading ease scores

The first step in producing readable content is cultivating audience awareness. Who are you writing for? Remember, readers will come to your content with varying educational backgrounds. If your content is unnecessarily lengthy or technical, you’ll frustrate and possibly lose your audience.

Here’s a good rule of thumb: If you’d like to reach a broad range of users, you should strive to write at a middle-school level. A 2003 Department of Education assessment showed “average” Americans read at a [seventh–eighth grade level](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93275.pdf). 

You may be tempted to disagree, reasoning “but my readers are highly educated! I can get away with complex and technical jargon, because they understand it.” In fact, studies show that the readers with the most education are the first to give up on content they can’t easily parse. 

Whenever possible, keep things simple, short, and clear.

Over time, organizations have developed myriad reading scores and indexes for measuring the “readability” of content. For example, the [Coleman-Liau index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index), the [SMOG index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG), and the [Gunning fog index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index). 

One that we find consistently suits our needs is the [Flesch-Kincaid grade level](http://www.editcentral.com/gwt1/EditCentral.html#style_diction). Developed for the U.S. Navy, Flesch-Kincaid measures sentence and word length. The more words in a sentence (and the more syllables in those words), the higher the grade level. 

Using these formulas will help you quickly estimate how difficult your text is. Each is a clear metric that can help you advocate for plain language. But, like every formula, they tend to miss the magic and unpredictable nature of human interaction. 

They also won't help you see that “patience you must have my young padawan,” is harder to read than “you must have patience, my young padawan.”
